Welcome to the WaNuLCAS 5.0 User Manual. This web application provides a comprehensive interface for simulating agroforestry scenarios.

## 1. Running the Application

There are several ways to access and run the WaNuLCAS Shiny application:

### 1.1. Online Access (Easiest)
You can directly access the application online without any installation at:
[https://wanulcas.agroforestri.id/](https://wanulcas.agroforestri.id/)

### 1.2. Run Directly from GitHub
To run the application locally without cloning the repository, open your R console or RStudio and run:

```r
# Install shiny if you haven't already
if (!require("shiny")) install.packages("shiny")

# Run the application from the GitHub repository
shiny::runGitHub("wanulcas", "degi")
```

### 1.3. Run Locally (Clone/Download)
If you prefer to have the source code on your machine:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/degi/wanulcas.git`
2. Open the project in RStudio or set your working directory to the downloaded folder.
3. Open `app.R` (or `ui.R`/`server.R`) and click **Run App** in RStudio, or run `shiny::runApp()` in your R console.

## 2. Introduction
WaNuLCAS simulates the balance of water, nutrients, and light capture in agroforestry systems dynamically over time. The application is divided into several main sections accessible via the navigation bar:
- **Home**: Main landing page
- **Input Parameters**: Define the characteristics of your system (Soil, Climate, Plants, etc.)
- **Simulation**: Run scenarios and analyze outcomes
- **About**: View tutorials, libraries, and references

Figure 2.1: Home page
![Home page](./manual_images/home.png)
*Provides a simple and welcoming entry to the WaNuLCAS application. From here, you can use the navigation bar to configure parameters, run simulations, or find out more information.*

## 3. Input Parameters

The **Input Parameters** section is where you specify all the necessary conditions for your simulation. Parameters are logically grouped into categories:

### 3.1. Agroforestry System
    
Figure 3.1: Agroforestry design
![Agroforestry design](./manual_images/agroforestry_design.png)
*This subpanel allows you to configure essential design features of the agroforestry plot such as tree spacing, zone allocation, and whether to include trees (`AF_AnyTrees?`), crops (`AF_AnyCrops?`), or weeds (`AF_SimulateWeeds?`). As noted in WaNuLCAS 4.0, the simulation relies on a 4-zone basic design (Zone 1 to 4) originating from the tree line, which allows the model to calculate the spatial distribution of light, water, and nutrient competition between tree and crop root systems over radial distance.*

- **Crop, Tree, and Oil Palm**, and **Weed** parameters have interactive libraries.

Figure 3.2: Crop selection
![Crop select](./manual_images/crop_select.png)
*Choose at most 5 predefined options or custom species from this list to simulate multi-species cropping structures. The selected crop type (`Ca_CType[Zone]`) will determine physiological parameters linked to the model.*

Figure 3.3: Crop parameters
![Crop parameters](./manual_images/crop_parameters.png)
*Within the species parameter panel, users can examine and edit physiological properties specific to the crop, including structural characteristics across growth stages. For instance, Specific Leaf Area (`Cq_SLA`, in m² g⁻¹) translates leaf biomass into canopy leaf area to calculate light interception. The Leaf Weight Ratio (`Cq_LWR`) determines the fraction of dry matter allocated to leaves, while canopy limits (`C_CanUp`, `C_CanLow`) define the vertical space occupied by the crop to simulate shading effects.*

Figure 3.4: Tree parameters
![Tree parameters](./manual_images/tree_parameters.png)
*Similarly to crop parameters, define biological tree properties for up to 3 different tree types simultaneously. Fields include light capture indicators (`T_SLA`, `T_LWR`) used to calculate the Tree Leaf Area Index. You can also define rooting strategies (`Rt_ATType`) to dictate how tree root length density is distributed across soil profiles over time, influencing spatial competition for water (`TW_Uptake`) and nutrients (`TN_Uptake`).*

Figure 3.5: Oil Palm parameters
![Oil Palm parameters](./manual_images/oilpalm_parameters.png)
*Specific parameters required for oil palm simulations, enabling the modeling of oil palm growth, fruit biomass, and yield.*

- You can **Add** or **Remove** species directly within the library subpanels prior to simulating.

Figure 3.6: Adding a new crop
![Add new crop](./manual_images/crop_add_new.png)
*Expand the provided datasets by defining completely new crop types. Fill out all required fields like physiology, biophysics, and parameters to incorporate it into your simulation library for crop intercropping interactions beyond the basic predefined 5 crop types.*

Figure 3.7: Editing a crop
![Edit crop](./manual_images/crop_edit.png)
*This is the interactive UI for editing crop species parameters. By clicking directly on the cells within this table, you can modify numerical values representing various physiological and morphological traits (e.g., specific leaf area, harvest index) directly in the database, allowing you to fine-tune the growth and responses of the crop in the simulation.*

Figure 3.8: Light Capture

Light capture is calculated on the basis of the leaf area index of the tree(s) and crop (T_LAI\[tree\] and C_LAI) for each zone, and their relative heights. In each zone the parameters T_CanLow\[tree\], T_CanUp\[tree\], C_CanLow, C_CanUp indicate lower and upper boundaries of crop and tree canopy, respectively. LAI is assumed to be homogeneously distributed between these boundaries.
![Light capture](./manual_images/light_capture.png)
*Adjust light capture interactions between different system components. You can modify the light extinction coefficients for leaves (`kLLight`) and woody biomass (`kBLight`). In the WaNuLCAS model, these coefficients govern how effectively the plant canopy intercepts incoming solar radiation based on its Leaf Area Index (LAI), directly driving potential transpiration and photosynthesis rates.*

Figure 3.9: Root parasitism
![Root parasitism](./manual_images/root_parasitism.png)
*Biological Interactions (Root Parasitism, Pest, Mycorrhiza) - Root parasitism. Configure the extent of biological constraints and interactions. For instance, you can set the fraction of root intersections infected by mycorrhiza (`Rt_MCInfFrac` for crops and `Rt_MTInfFrac` for trees), which in the simulation increases the effective root length for phosphorus uptake by extending the depletion zone. You can also include pests (`PD`) impacting aboveground biomass.*

Figure 3.10: Pest
![Pest](./manual_images/pest.png)
*Biological Interactions (Root Parasitism, Pest, Mycorrhiza) - Pest. Configure the extent of biological constraints and interactions. For instance, you can set the fraction of root intersections infected by mycorrhiza (`Rt_MCInfFrac` for crops and `Rt_MTInfFrac` for trees), which in the simulation increases the effective root length for phosphorus uptake by extending the depletion zone. You can also include pests (`PD`) impacting aboveground biomass.*

### 3.4. Management

Apart from yield effects of agroforestry, labour requirements have a strong impact on profitability, and for this one should compare additional labour use (eg. tree pruning) and labour saving aspects (eg. weed control). Complementarity of resource use can be based on a difference in timing of tree and crop resource demand. If the tree picks up the 'left overs' from the cropping period, as occurs with water in the *Grevillea* maize systems in Kenya (Ong; *pers. comm.*) and transforms these resources into valuable products, a considerable degree of competition during the temporal overlap may be acceptable to the farmer. If tree products have no direct value, agroforestry systems may only be justified if F_(noncomp) \> C_(nonrecycl). With increasing direct value of the tree products, the requirements for complementarity decrease.
